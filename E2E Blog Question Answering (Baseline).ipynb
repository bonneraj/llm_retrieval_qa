      "Documents:   ['Did you know that 85% of cloud network security incidents stem from user error? Your cloud data may be in danger due to a variety of factors, including staff errors, unsecured Wi-Fi connections, employee theft, accidental deletions, and disgruntled workers. The widespread adoption of cloud technology and its rising sophistication and volume, present new cyberthreats necessitating the use of cybersecurity.\\n\\nHere are some suggestions for improving the security of data stored in the cloud:\\n\\nCreate a strong password\\n\\nEnable encryption\\n\\nContinuous monitoring and observability\\n\\nEnable local backup\\n\\nEnable additional security controls\\n\\nAvoid storing unnecessary information\\n\\nHow Important is Cloud Security?\\n\\nTo secure extremely sensitive corporate data from hackers, organizations must move their sensitive data and applications to the cloud. The following are some further justifications that clarify the principles of cloud security:\\n\\n1. Limit access\\n\\nA business can monitor and control who has access to or permission to use its data thanks to accessing control in cloud security. It is done by creating policies that are preferred by the organization.\\n\\nAccess control in cloud security enables enterprises to see their user activity and data at an elevated level. End users can benefit from strong role-based access, flexibility, and autonomy thanks to cloud administration and configuration tools.\\n\\n2. Data encryption\\n\\nAlthough data leaks and breaches are unavoidable, you can still protect the data using encryption techniques. To lessen the effects of compromised keys, you can utilize numerous keys. These keys should be rotated on a regular basis under strict access and control regulations.\\n\\n3. Enable automation\\n\\nAutomation can reduce configuration errors and human errors. According to PaloAlto’s analysis, customers will be at fault for 99% of cloud security failures by 2025. Automation ensures that the infrastructure is set up and deployed correctly using audited and tested configurations.\\n\\nMany IT companies make use of cloud automation software that is integrated with the virtualized environment. It is used to speed up repetitive operations like creating infrastructure as code, defining common configuration items, and provisioning virtual resources.\\n\\n4. Implement Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)\\n\\nMFA (Multi-factor Authentication) has quickly become a popular authentication and security measure for business web and mobile applications.\\n\\nMost common data breaches are linked to weak or reused passwords because of inefficient measures employed by numerous firms.\\n\\nThe MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) implementation is thought to be the least expensive and most efficient security measure to safeguard your company against hackers attempting to access your cloud apps. Only authorized workers will be granted access to cloud apps and your sensitive business data by safeguarding your cloud users with multi-factor authentication.\\n\\n5. Vulnerability Management (VM)\\n\\nSecurity programs called vulnerability management tools monitor an organization’s networks for risks or openings that burglars could take advantage of. These instruments are made for controlling network attacks.\\n\\nThis program offers solutions and prompts action when a scan reveals a threat on the network, reducing the likelihood of a network attack.\\n\\nIn contrast to traditional firewalls, anti-spyware or antivirus programs, intrusion detection systems, and vulnerability management solutions look for potential dangers and patch them to prevent further attacks.\\n\\nCloud computing is without a doubt the technology of the future and it requires you to start protecting your cloud activities right away!\\n\\nLast Words\\n\\nTo ensure complete security, your organization needs to evaluate your cloud security strategy and policies more carefully. Infinitive’s AWS Certified Cloud Practitioners have the knowledge and expertise to improve the security and functionality of your current cloud program and safeguard sensitive data by managing your cloud services and employing industry best practices.

For example, in both platforms we are able to track average time on page, but the difference in how we track that data leads to some discrepancies. Universal Analytics tracked sessions based on the timeout session, which means a new session was triggered if an activity happened within the timeout session. GA4 evolved into a new concept called engaged sessions. Engaged sessions are based on user interactions or an event. In Universal Analytics, the user was tracked based on the unique identifier in their cookie, so if they went to your site on a different device they would be counted as a new user. Furthermore, GA4 also uses the unique identifier, but it can handle tracking cross-device and cross platform, allowing for a more accurate understanding of the user across multiple sessions and devices. In Universal Analytics it was simple, Google was tracking the individual user so they could see their average time on each page. In GA4 the only way to get average time on page is to divide total engaged time by engaged sessions. If a user exits your page before triggering an event, the time spent on the page may not be accurate. These are examples of how both platforms have average time on page, sessions, users, bounce rates, etc., but are being tracked differently.\\n\\nUniversal Analytics was very successful at giving an overall view of the user journey along with how customers arrived at your website. The long list of tracking data allowed you to set up various goals for each traffic source. Unfortunately, Universal Analytics fell short with privacy compliance and displaying the customer journey. In today’s sales funnel, a customer comes to your website many times across many devices, so Universal Analytics tracking all these visits as separate users is a huge disadvantage. GA4 is the exact opposite, it is a very comprehensive platform that allows you to track your customer across multiple devices and touchpoints, displaying a more accurate buyer funnel. In my opinion Universal Analytics was all about the user not giving a fully accurate representation of the buyer, whereas GA4 is all about the customer giving you data to better understand your customers journey.

Often, though, desired insights are out-of-reach due to a lack of context and inability to join islands of data in a meaningful way. Relational databases will only get you so far. Enter graph technology.\\n\\nA “graph” is a data structure that focuses on the logical relationships among data entities. Graph analytics (a.k.a., network analysis or link analysis) is used to explore these relationships to gain insights. Some well-known graph databases are Neo4j, AWS Neptune, Oracle Spatial, and Franz AllegroGraph, which are optimized to support this relationship structure and even have specialized query languages such as Gremlin, Cypher or SPARQL.\\n\\nPicture the data behind LinkedIn or any social network, which is perfectly suited for a graph structure. Users are connected to other users at many levels in a vast network. They also belong to groups, work for companies, and share posts – and these posts can be commented on, liked, celebrated, loved, etc. Each of these connections and actions between entities can be represented in a graph structure. Here’s a simplified example of what that structure might look like:\\n\\nWhy Graph Technology\\n\\nThe power of graph technology lies in its flexibility, intuitive structure, and unique relationship-based insights. Graph databases excel at linking data from disparate data sources, making it easy to create and expand a connected view of entities (known as nodes or vertices) such as customers, employees, products, transactions, etc. The relationships between entities (known as edges or links) typically reflect a subject>predicate>object structure. The relationships can also be directional as illustrated above (e.g., Bob Comments on a post).\\n\\nGraph analysis can provide unique insights by focusing on these relationships, looking at patterns and the nature of the connections. For example, Centrality is a core concept of graph analytics and is used to evaluate the relative importance of entities in the network. Centrality-based analysis considers how many connections an entity has, whether they are inbound vs. outbound relationships, or whether an entity is in the shortest path between two others.\\n\\nGraph analytics is so powerful that Gartner predicts a huge growth for the technology coming years. In a recent study, the research group predicted not only that data and analytics would become a core business function in 2021 but that graph technologies would be used 80% of the time by 2025, up from 10% in 2021.\\n\\nGraph Technology in Action\\n\\nGraph technology is a great choice for many different analytics use cases and can be utilized in virtually any industry or function. Below are just a few examples of the insights that can be gained:\\n\\nBusiness Continuity Management : Develop a holistic view of potential risks associated with the many dependencies that comprise a business continuity plan.\\n\\n: Develop a holistic view of potential risks associated with the many dependencies that comprise a business continuity plan.

To Go Faster and Get More Customer-Focused\\n\\nThe Agile Value Proposition: Cutting Planning and Execution Cycles from Weeks to Hours\\n\\nHow to Make the Move to Agile\\n\\nWhat a difference a few decades make! When it was launched in 2001 with a manifesto, Agile was considered an alternative way to develop software. I was there in the middle of it, working for an innovative consulting firm that delivered custom software using Agile when our clients had never heard of it. In less than 20 years, it’s become the central management philosophy for many of the world’s largest and best companies. The recent cover story in Harvard Business Review asked whether “whole segments of the business learn to operate in this manner?” and “Would scaling up Agile improve corporate performance as much as Agile methods improve individual team performance?” Based on my experience leading Agile innovation, these are definitely some of the right questions. The truth is, Agile works as much as a management principle or cultural mindset as a framework for software development. The original manifesto is correctly focused on values and behaviors – such as “customer collaboration” and “responding to change” – rather than specific processes or technology. These concepts can be applied to all types of business functions. I am currently working with my colleagues across Infinitive to embed Agile in everything we do. The value results from the emphasis on what’s most important, incremental progress, and the ability to be introspective and learn. These attributes and ways of working offer clear advantages over traditional modes that featured strict procedure, hierarchical decision making and excessive planning.Current business realities have also sparked the rise of Agile. In order to remain competitive, organizations have gotten closer to their customers, become more responsive and continually evolved and adapted. Massive transformation programs have been replaced by product-focused teams developing deep knowledge and continually delivering against needs of the greatest value. And Agile makes a great deal of sense in a world of rapid prototyping, minimally viable products and test-and-learn models. Looking beyond Agile’s traditional home in IT, how can leaders in other parts of the business apply its principles to meaningful effect?: For operations teams, consider the constant pressures to evolve business processes to become more efficient, cost-effective and productive. Process improvement is well suited to Agile, whether cost, efficiency, quality or other drivers are your primary target; incremental improvement allows you to test if changes have the desired impact or even an unexpected adverse impact. And better yet, it keeps the needs of your customer, whether internal or external, front and center. Agile can also be applied to strategic planning and portfolio management, especially relative to building business cases, prioritizing steps and improving outputs from the value chain. That’s especially important for processes or workstreams that cut across functional, departmental or business unit lines. It may seem counterintuitive, but decreasing the time to value and reducing individual value targets for individual initiatives may make it easier to build momentum toward strategic goals.: Marketers typically “think Agile.” So it’s no surprise they have been early adopters. For example, A/B testing of creative materials and/or campaign structures is a form of Agile, as is incorporating newly available data into decision making. Marketing groups have ample opportunity to formalize their use of Agile. They can conduct sprints to better understand certain customer segments or geographies, and then refine campaigns and offers accordingly. They can also more methodically adopt martech and third-party data sets (e.g., adding data sets in sequence across a defined time period).: These functions have not been historically fertile ground for Agile, especially in those industries where selling is primarily relationship-based. However, within sales operations and management, an Agile approach could improve communication, contact management, forecasting and reporting processes. Standardizing assets and tools and enhancing data quality within key systems could help sales organizations become more data-driven; that’s a challenging goal for sales leaders in many industries, but certainly one which Agile could help them achieve faster and with less resistance.: Agile has come to the HR world, too. As an HBR piece had it: “In an Agile organization, HR needs to provide the same services it’s always provided — hiring, professional development, performance management — but in ways that are responsive to the ongoing changes in the culture and work style of the organization.” Embracing Agile means HR leaders orient on the needs of their internal customers and view their services as products. Further, it can help them understand the unique talents and mindsets are necessary for organizations to adopt Agile at greater scale. Early adopters in HR have used “retrospectives” to ensure internal customers are satisfied with new hires and to incrementally improve interview questions and formats and onboarding processes.: And finally, in finance, Agile offers distinct value to finance leaders who are seeking to reposition as strategic advisors to the business, rather than just financial scorekeepers. Increasing the speed with which decisions are made and standardizing the data sets that are used to make decisions are two Agile techniques that finance can adopt.At Infinitive, we help enable and activate the principles and techniques within our clients’ operations. Using Agile in our data-driven marketing engagements to fantastic results. At a top 10 U.S. bank, we reduced the time it took to plan and execute marketing campaigns from weeks to hours. For a global oil and gas company, we helped transform the marketing function into a data-driven, Agile-enabled operation. Through a global programmatic advertising strategy and Agile enablement, the team was able to incrementally improve campaign design and execution much more efficiently than in the past. At a global credit card firm, we established Agile-based process improvement strategies, again helping establish data-driven thinking and Agile action as a “way of life” for the marketing group.To get Agile, leaders in these functions should turn to proven techniques for starting what will be a long-term journey. Instilling Agile as a core principle and cultural attribute takes work but is a necessary foundational step. The organizational mindset must shift to products and outputs, not processes and projects. Establishing a fully committed and highly collaborative team for the first Agile initiatives can help demonstrate its value. Ideally, those teams should be cross-functional and include a range of stakeholders. Engage IT and/or partners and vendors with Agile knowledge and experience to build a network that can share toolsets, lessons learned and proven techniques. This is the context where Agile works best. The bottom line: While some skeptics believe that Agile is diluted when it leaves the realm of IT, I believe that the mindset and principles offer great value to leaders across the organization. I appreciate that Agile does not fit everywhere in an organization. However, for leaders that want to get closer to their customers, foster greater accountability and collaboration in teams, and make measurable improvements in their organizations, the time to try Agile is now. As the pressure to produce and pace of change will only increase, there is no need that Agile should remain just an “IT thing!”', metadata={'index': 60, 'url': 'https://www.infinitive.com/agile-is-everywhere-or-should-be-use-cases-and-best-practices-for-leaders-across-the-business/', 'title': 'Agile Is Everywhere – Or Should Be: Use Cases and Best Practices for Leaders Across the Business', 'author': \"['Infinitive Difference Blog']\", 'keywords': \"['marketing', 'help', 'processes', 'improve', 'best', 'data', 'value', 'practices', 'cases', 'leaders', 'business', 'management', 'agile']\", 'summary': 'To Go Faster and Get More Customer-FocusedThe Agile Value Proposition: Cutting Planning and Execution Cycles from Weeks to HoursHow to Make the Move to AgileWhat a difference a few decades make!\\nThe recent cover story in Harvard Business Review asked whether “whole segments of the business learn to operate in this manner?” and “Would scaling up Agile improve corporate performance as much as Agile methods improve individual team performance?” Based on my experience leading Agile innovation, these are definitely some of the right questions.\\n: For operations teams, consider the constant pressures to evolve business processes to become more efficient, cost-effective and productive.\\nAgile can also be applied to strategic planning and portfolio management, especially relative to building business cases, prioritizing steps and improving outputs from the value chain.\\n: And finally, in finance, Agile offers distinct value to finance leaders who are seeking to reposition as strategic advisors to the business, rather than just financial scorekeepers.', 'metadata': \"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'robots': 'index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1', 'description': 'What a difference a few decades make!

This week, Infinitive hosted re:Wind, a webinar recapping our experience at re:Invent, which included new AWS announcements and track highlights from analytics, compute, AI/ML, and management tools. During our webinar, Tiho Cheresharski, one of Infinitive’s Sales Engineers and Mike Sellery, Infinitive’s Director of Cloud Migration shared emerging themes and key takeaways from the AWS conference moderated by Don Rippert, Infinitive’s Director of Market Development.\\n\\nHarnessing The Power of Data\\n\\nThis year at re:Invent, AWS focused on highlighting the refinement and maturing of their existing product offerings. A big emphasis was placed on enabling organizations to focus on their business, while saving time and energy when integrating AWS solutions. There were many announcements about AWS technologies, the following are just a few that we think are the most important.\\n\\nData and Analytics\\n\\nData and analytics announcements talked about building a future-proof data foundation for organizations that democratizes data and breaks down silos by integrating AWS ecosystems, removing steps from the ETL process, and improving the speed of data movement.\\n\\nAmazon Redshift introduced new features that ease the ingestion of data and make analyzing data faster and easier. Some of the capabilities include auto-copy from S3, Amazon Aurora zero ETL integration with Amazon Redshift, Amazon Redshift Streaming ingestion, and Amazon Redshift Integration for Apache Spark.\\n\\nCompute\\n\\nBetter, faster, cheaper…pick two. But what if you can have it all? AWS compute services provide organizations with secure and resizable compute capacity that has easy scalability. At re:Invent, AWS revealed its new Graviton3E chip that will boost performance efficiency yet again beyond the already impressive levels possible with Graviton 2. In addition, the company announced that SnapStart can reduce Java cold starts by up to 50% on AWS Lambda functions.\\n\\nAI/ML\\n\\nAutomate, integrate, collaborate! Enabling machine learning at scale was a major theme at the conference. Sessions highlighted the importance of accelerating data preparation, debugging model training, monitoring models during deployment, and improving organizational governance, collaboration, and accessibility.\\n\\nNew AI/ML AWS announcements revolved around new Studio Notebooks, Role Manager for better governance, Model Cards for improved documentation, and Model Dashboards for monitoring models in SageMaker. Additionally, AWS announced the introduction of Amazon CodeWhisperer which helps generate code recommendations in real-time.\\n\\nManagement Tools\\n\\nBest practice by default – every AWS production customer should be leveraging management tools to save time and effort. AWS Control Tower can be used to apply managed preventative, detective, and proactive controls to accounts and organizational units by service, control objective, or compliance framework. Now, the most important management tools feature an easier menu of compliance options with a simple checkbox and more automated actions to correct things that go astray, not just report on them.\\n\\nre:Invent Your Organization’s Future\\n\\nWhether it’s your first year or your 10th year attending AWS re:Invent, you know the amount of information presented at the conference exceeds what we can cover in one webinar and blog post.

In our first blog of the Consumer Intelligence series (1st Party Data, Clean Rooms, and Privacy — Why it’s so Hot), we emphasized the importance of your 1st party data and how Infinitive helps companies get the value out of their data by a 3-step process – Collect, Protect, and Connect. Our second blog laid the groundwork for (‘How to Optimize Your 1st Party Data – Step 1: Collect’). In this article, we will dive into the next key step in the process: “Protect your 1st party data”.\\n\\nWhen it comes to Protecting your data, there are two critical focus points to look at across your business processes and data architectures: 1) protecting your consumer and 2) protecting your business.\\n\\nPrivacy across the globe – Protecting Your Consumer\\n\\nFor several years, consumer data privacy has been at the forefront of social media headlines and legislators’ dockets across the globe. In 2018, the EU started the protection movement by enacting the consumer data privacy law known as the ‘General Data Protection Regulation’ (GDPR). Soon after, California led the way in the US with a state-specific consumer privacy law, the ‘California Consumer Privacy Act’ (CCPA) which became effective in 2020. Four years later we are now experiencing how the laws are being interpreted, what fines are being issued, and what impacts the legislation will have to our business processes and technology when we are engaging with our consumers, platforms, and apps. But, in case you were not keeping a close eye on the scoreboard, there are now 4 more states that have followed in California’s footsteps with state specific legislation including: Colorado, Virginia, Utah, and Connecticut. So, does this mean that as business leaders we should expect to manage rules and policies across 50 different state-specific privacy laws? That sounds like a nightmare and depending on what states you have large numbers of consumers in, it’s one you might need to start living sooner rather later.\\n\\nHot Off the Press – ADPPA\\n\\nOn June 30, 2022 the House Energy and Commerce Committee introduced the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, H.R. 8152 (‘ADPPA’) which outlined the US federal consumer privacy framework. Where other federal attempts have failed, the ADPPA is a bipartisan approach to “strike a meaningful balance on key issues” to reduce complexity of a 50-state ‘food-fight’ of differing or even contradictory laws and policies, as stated by Roger Wicker, a Senate Commerce Committee Ranker Member.\\n\\nFor example, a key focus of the ADPPA bill is around ‘Consumer Control and Consent’. This gives consumers various rights over their personal data including the right to access, correct, and delete the data which you collect on them. It requires you to get affirmative consent from consumers before using their data and grants consumers the ability to deny you from sharing their data with other third-party entities or organizations. Another key piece of the legislation to watch is ‘Data Minimalization’, which imposes a requirement on organizations to not collect specific consumer data unless it is “reasonably necessary” as defined by the FTC’s definition. This minimalization of data collection happens regardless of consumer consent or transparency.\\n\\nIt is critical that your organization focuses on understanding the current and future laws, restrictions, policies, and most importantly what processes and technology solutions you will need to implement to protect your consumers’ 1st party privacy. Infinitive has deep experience in designing and implementing the processes and technical capabilities organizations need to comply with the privacy policies defined above, in the CCPA, and as additional laws are enacted. By starting with a proven strategy and plan, you can ensure that you will meet the needs of regulators while continuing to enhance your trusted consumer relationships. You can learn more about how to implement Consumer Privacy solutions here: ‘Staying Ahead of Consumer Privacy Data Laws‘.\\n\\nData Governance in the cloud – Protecting your Business\\n\\nNot only do you need to make sure you are compliant in the privacy of the 1st party data that you are collecting, but you must also guarantee that you are protecting that data from improper access, ensuring its ongoing accuracy, and making it available when it is needed.\\n\\nHaving strong policies, procedures, standards, and controls specific to data protection is crucial to your Enterprise Data Governance strategy. These concepts apply to all customer data, whether managed in single cloud, multi-cloud, on-prem, or with a third party. Data protection is a part of Infinitive’s ‘Cloud Governance Model and Framework’, with a special focus on user identity and access management – ensuring that the right people have access to the right data.\\n\\nFor many, the word ‘Governance’ can feel like a restrictive straight jacket trying to slow down data access, decisions, and overall business growth. But the key is being able to see data governance NOT as a necessary evil, but instead as a business enabler. For example, leading organizations focus to establish great data governance programs to:\\n\\nGain a Competitive Advantage – Increasing the speed of getting services to market, efficiency gains, and creating a better customer experience to differentiate your organization from your competitors. Manage Risks – Leading organizations blend legacy and new cloud-based technologies to ensure PII Data Security while decreasing reputation and financial risk. Lower Risk Profiles – Comprehensive Policies, Standards, Controls, and Procedures (PSCP) are the hallmarks of mature organizations, ensuring that organizational and compliance risks are mitigated effectively.\\n\\nProtecting your trusted consumer relationships is key to continued business growth and it begins with a commitment to protecting your consumers’ privacy AND the security and access of that data. With Infinitive’s Cloud Governance Model and Framework, your organization can increase revenue, improve the customer experience, lower operation costs, and drive efficiencies in the cloud. Our privacy and data governance experts can help you navigate the ever-changing legal and policy landscape while working alongside you to implement solutions that will Protect 1st party data.\\n\\nLooking ahead: Step 3 – Connect\\n\\nNow that you have collected and protected your consumer 1st party data, it is time to get the value out of your data and leverage it for increased revenue, audience growth, amplified engagement, stronger partner connections, improved product decisions, and deeper consumer relationships. Stay tuned for our next blog, Step 3: Connect your data.', metadata={'index': 130, 'url': 'https://www.infinitive.com/how-to-optimize-your-1st-party-data-step-2-protect/', 'title': 'How to Optimize Your 1st Party Data - Step 2: Protect', 'author': \"['Evina Denenberg']\", 'keywords': \"['protecting', '1st', 'protect', 'step', 'party', 'optimize', 'consumers', 'privacy', 'data', 'governance', 'organizations', 'consumer', 'policies']\", 'summary': 'In our first blog of the Consumer Intelligence series (1st Party Data, Clean Rooms, and Privacy — Why it’s so Hot), we emphasized the importance of your 1st party data and how Infinitive helps companies get the value out of their data by a 3-step process – Collect, Protect, and Connect.\\nOur second blog laid the groundwork for (‘How to Optimize Your 1st Party Data – Step 1: Collect’).\\nIn this article, we will dive into the next key step in the process: “Protect your 1st party data”.\\nYou can learn more about how to implement Consumer Privacy solutions here: ‘Staying Ahead of Consumer Privacy Data Laws‘.\\nOur privacy and data governance experts can help you navigate the ever-changing legal and policy landscape while working alongside you to implement solutions that will Protect 1st party data.', 'metadata': \"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'robots': 'index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1', 'description': 'When it comes to Protecting your data, there are two critical focus points to look at across your business processes and data architectures: 1) protecting your consumer and 2) protecting your business.', 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'How to Optimize Your 1st Party Data - Step 2: Protect', 'description': 'When it comes to Protecting your data, there are two critical focus points to look at across your business processes and data architectures: 1) protecting your consumer and 2) protecting your business.', 'url': 'https://www.infinitive.com/how-to-optimize-your-1st-party-data-step-2-protect/', 'site_name': 'Infinitive', 'image': {'identifier': 'https://www.infinitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1296691609-jpg.webp', 'width': 2121, 'height': 1414, 'type': 'image/jpeg'}}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.facebook.com/Infinitive/', 'published_time': '2022-08-08T15:56:18+00:00', 'modified_time': '2023-07-25T13:19:15+00:00'}, 'author': 'Evina Denenberg', 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'creator': '@infinitiveinc', 'site': '@infinitiveinc', 'label1': 'Written by', 'data1': 'Evina Denenberg', 'label2': 'Est. reading time', 'data2': '6 minutes'}, 'generator': 'Elementor 3.15.3; features: e_dom_optimization, e_optimized_assets_loading, e_optimized_css_loading; settings: css_print_method-external, google_font-enabled, font_display-auto', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.infinitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/orange-bug.svg'})\", 'publishing_timestamp': '2022-08-08 15:56:18+00:00'})]}\n"

External data available to an organization can be purchased via data marketplaces or provided via agreements with suppliers and partners. This external data can dramatically improve an organization’s ability to sell, deliver and maintain its products and services.\\n\\n3. Data normalization. Raw data may contain inconsistencies, errors, or missing values. Data transformation techniques, such as cleaning and standardization, help to ensure data consistency, accuracy, and completeness. Normalizing data also improves comparability across different datasets.\\n\\n4. Data analysis. Transformation prepares data for analysis by converting it into a suitable format for statistical modeling, machine learning algorithms, or other analytical techniques.

       "  Document(page_content='Mastering the data details\\n\\nAutomation in the big picture\\n\\nTo ensure data transformation and transfer issues are identified and addressed before migration to a new OMS\\n\\nTo reduce the time it takes to import data after each test run, thereby facilitating a seamless migration into production environments\\n\\nGiven the continuous advancements in digital advertising technology and the steady pace of consolidation in the industry, it’s almost inevitable that publishers and media organizations will upgrade their existing or migrate to entirely new platforms and toolsets. That’s true of all of the essential components of the ad tech stack, including order management systems (OMS), ad servers and billing software. It’s no surprise, then, that publishers and media firms are looking for the most efficient and effective ways to handle upgrades and migrations from old to new systems. That’s where automation tools come in. Certainly, automating certain data extraction and migration processes can be highly beneficial. In fact, how you structure the data and how you use automation in data migration can make the difference between outstanding and mediocre ROI and determine whether or not you fulfill the business case for new or upgraded systems. But, as with so much else in the ad tech world, the devil is both in the details and in the big-picture context. Automation can’t be viewed as a one-size-fits-all undertaking, because the nuances of ad tech environments vary considerably across media companies. Business processes are different across media brands. So too are “secret sauce” product offerings and audience profiles. So what’s the role of automation? In our experience, automated tools should do the heavy lifting in migrating massive amounts of data off legacy technology and onto new systems and in testing that the data comes over accurately and appropriately. The benefits are faster timelines, fewer resources needed and lower error rates in migrating data.Automation alone doesn’t make for a perfect migration. Without careful mapping and modeling of data sets and product taxonomies and a detailed understanding of the differences between old and new systems, publishers are at risk of “garbage in, garbage out” scenarios and “apples-to-oranges” mismatches. Few systems allow for direct, 1-to-1 transfers of data. Line items and fields simply don’t match up exactly across, say, Operative OMS and Google DSM systems and ad servers. Thus, it’s necessary to understand how specific types of data are treated across systems. Similarly, successful migrations require that templates and mapping models reflect specific product, fulfillment and billing requirements. In other words, the use of automated tools should reflect business needs and objectives, rather than being defined by what automation can or can’t do.Thinking contextually about the key steps in a data migration clarifies the role and value of automation. For example, automation is a relatively straightforward process when extracting data. And transformation templates can help automate the process of preparing data to be loaded into a new OMS, ad server or other system. The load process is automated, too, of course. But these migration steps can – and should – be backed up by robust and iterative testing and validation processes within sandbox environments. Accelerated validations and systemic verification ensures data is migrating in line with business requirements and project objectives. But, again, automated tools must be designed and configured so they “know” what needs to be validated – not just that data came over, but that it was transferred to the right fields. Did quantitative data come over properly? Did open text and qualitative information end up in the right fields? In this way, automation helps reduce validation time frames. It also allows project teams to refine transformation logic based on the results of initial migrations to staging environments. The goals are simple:A series of automated test runs, with multiple validation points and other specific criteria for both quantitative and non-quantitative data, should be conducted prior to the production run. Again, this is how media companies can avoid the dreaded “garbage in, garbage out” and “apples-to-oranges” situations. So how do you make these adjustments? A combination of expertise and experience is essential. The key is to recognize how product taxonomies, account and campaign data, invoice line items, metrics, impressions, product definitions and attributes and other elements differ across the two systems. For example, FatTail allows for “flexible” ad sizes which means they can be entered/updated during line item creation, while other systems require you to define an ad size during product creation and cannot be altered during order entry. More broadly, if your data is of questionable quality in system A, you may want to make refinements before moving it to system B. No wonder that moving to a new OMS often leads publisher to consider rationalizing their product portfolios and otherwise enhancing their data. It’s best to know the common pitfalls and risks in moving from software A to software B. That way, automated tools and pre-configured templates can be adjusted to align or to solve for publishers’ specific and unique needs, product portfolios and IT environments. The challenges and complexities are directly proportionate to the size and structure of the companies. Aggregating campaigns and data across systems for a multi-brand media conglomerate is much more difficult than it is for standalone properties. The bottom line is that automation accelerates effective transitions for publishers adopting new ad tech. But the most effective automation is designed with both specific company and IT details and big-picture business objectives in mind.', metadata={'index': 0, 'url': 'https://www.infinitive.com/the-role-and-value-of-automation-in-adopting-new-ad-tech/', 'title': 'The Role and Value of Automation in Adopting New Ad Tech', 'author': \"['Infinitive Difference Blog']\", 'keywords': \"['tech', 'automation', 'media', 'adopting', 'role', 'systems', 'data', 'product', 'ad', 'automated', 'tools', 'specific', 'value', 'migration']\", 'summary': 'That’s true of all of the essential components of the ad tech stack, including order management systems (OMS), ad servers and billing software.\\nThat’s where automation tools come in.\\nAutomation can’t be viewed as a one-size-fits-all undertaking, because the nuances of ad tech environments vary considerably across media companies.\\nSimilarly, successful migrations require that templates and mapping models reflect specific product, fulfillment and billing requirements.\\nThe bottom line is that automation accelerates effective transitions for publishers adopting new ad tech.', 'metadata': \"defaultdict(<class 'dict'>, {'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1', 'robots': 'index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1', 'description': 'Given the continuous advancements in digital advertising technology and the steady pace of consolidation in the industry, it’s almost inevitable that', 'og': {'locale': 'en_US', 'type': 'article', 'title': 'The Role and Value of Automation in Adopting New Ad Tech', 'description': 'Given the continuous advancements in digital advertising technology and the steady pace of consolidation in the industry, it’s almost inevitable that', 'url': 'https://www.infinitive.com/the-role-and-value-of-automation-in-adopting-new-ad-tech/', 'site_name': 'Infinitive'}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.facebook.com/Infinitive/', 'published_time': '2018-07-26T02:14:39+00:00', 'modified_time': '2023-04-07T14:29:04+00:00'}, 'author': 'Infinitive Difference Blog', 'twitter': {'card': 'summary_large_image', 'creator': '@infinitiveinc', 'site': '@infinitiveinc', 'label1': 'Written by', 'data1': 'Infinitive Difference Blog', 'label2': 'Est. reading time', 'data2': '5 minutes'}, 'generator': 'Elementor 3.15.3; features: e_dom_optimization, e_optimized_assets_loading, e_optimized_css_loading; settings: css_print_method-external, google_font-enabled, font_display-auto', 'msapplication-TileImage': 'https://www.infinitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/orange-bug.svg'})\", 'publishing_timestamp': '2018-07-26 02:14:39+00:00'}),\n",
